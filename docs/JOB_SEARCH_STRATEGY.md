# Job Search Strategy Guide
## Landing Your First Developer Role

Joel, you have an **incredible** story and a **production app** to prove your skills. Here's your strategic game plan for landing your first dev role.

---

## 🎯 YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

**Most bootcamp grads DON'T have:**
- ✅ Production app with real users
- ✅ Cross-platform deployment experience
- ✅ AI integration (hot skill right now!)
- ✅ Unique backstory (memorable in interviews)
- ✅ 20 years of professional work experience
- ✅ Proven communication skills

**What this means:**
You're not competing with bootcamp grads. You're competing with junior devs who have 1-2 years experience—and you can match them on technical skills while offering MORE on soft skills.

## 🎤 INTERVIEW PREP

### Your Story (Master This):

**"Tell me about yourself"** (2-minute version):

> I'm a full-stack developer with a unique background. I first learned to code in 2002 building church websites from books I bought at Waldenbooks, but I spent the next 20 years as a high school English teacher and softball coach.
>
> In 2022, I decided to return to coding and discovered everything had changed—React, Node.js, modern JavaScript. Instead of being intimidated, I dove in and spent two years mastering modern web development through freeCodeCamp, Microsoft Learn, and building projects.
>
> Three months ago, I put everything to the test and built ShelfQuest—a cross-platform digital library app with AI-powered insights. It's now live on Windows Store with iOS and Android launches in progress. I built the entire stack: React frontend, Node.js backend, Python microservice, Supabase database, and Google Gemini AI integration.
>
> What I love most about development is the same thing I loved about teaching: solving complex problems and seeing the impact when things click. Now I'm ready to bring this execution speed and my unique perspective to a professional team.

### Common Questions & Your Answers:

**"Why are you changing careers?"**
> Teaching showed me I love explaining complex concepts and solving problems systematically. When I returned to coding in 2022, I realized software development lets me do this at scale—I can build tools that help thousands of people, not just my classroom. ShelfQuest, my reading app, combines both: it's educational technology built by someone who deeply understands the education space.

**"Why don't you have professional experience?"**
> I wanted to prove I could build production software before applying to teams. ShelfQuest isn't a portfolio project—it's a real app serving users on Windows Store, with iOS and Android launches in progress. I've proven I can architect systems, make technical decisions, ship code, and iterate based on user feedback. Now I'm ready to bring these skills to a professional environment where I can learn from experienced developers.

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**
> I'm still learning team collaboration workflows since I've been working solo. I understand Git, code reviews, and agile concepts, but I haven't practiced them on a real team yet. That's actually one of the main reasons I'm excited to join a professional team—to learn from experienced developers and contribute to a codebase with established patterns and practices.

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**
> Growing into a strong mid-level or senior developer who can mentor others, especially people transitioning into tech. I'd love to be the person who helps other career-changers see that it's possible. Technically, I want to deepen my expertise in [whatever matches the company—AI, frontend architecture, EdTech, etc.] and potentially contribute to open source in that space.

**"Why our company?"**
[Research company beforehand. Mention:]
- Specific product/project that excites you
- Company mission/values that align with yours
- Technical stack you're excited about
- Recent news/funding/launch
- Real reason you want to work there

### Technical Questions:

You'll likely be asked to:
- Explain ShelfQuest architecture
- Code a simple algorithm (practice LeetCode Easy)
- Discuss React concepts (hooks, state, props, lifecycle)
- Explain async JavaScript (promises, async/await)
- Describe API design decisions
- Talk about a technical challenge you solved

**Prepare by:**
- Reviewing ShelfQuest codebase thoroughly
- Practicing on LeetCode (20-30 Easy problems)
- Doing mock interviews on Pramp
- Explaining technical concepts out loud
- Having examples of debugging stories ready
