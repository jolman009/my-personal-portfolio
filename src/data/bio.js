  tagline: "From teaching English to building production apps—I'm a self-taught developer who built a cross-platform reading app with AI in 3 months.",
  
  story: {
    intro: `I first learned to code in 2002, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from books I bought at Waldenbooks. I built websites for my church and youth ministry, but life took me in a different direction—I became a high school English teacher and head varsity softball coach.`,
    
    comeback: `Twenty years later, in August 2022, I decided to return to coding. The landscape had completely transformed—what I knew had evolved into React, Node.js, modern JavaScript, and an entire ecosystem of frameworks and tools. Instead of being intimidated, I embraced the challenge.`,
    
    journey: `Over the past 2.5 years, I immersed myself in modern web development through freeCodeCamp, Microsoft Learn, YouTube tutorials, and countless practice projects. But nothing prepared me like building something real.`,
    
    shelfquest: `Three months ago, I put everything I'd learned to the test and built ShelfQuest—a full-stack, cross-platform digital library app with AI-powered insights, offline reading, and real-time sync. It's now live on the Windows Store, with Google Play and Apple App Store launches in progress.`,
    
    now: `I've proven I can build production-ready applications from concept to deployment. Now I'm seeking my first professional developer role where I can bring this same drive, adaptability, and execution to a team building products that matter.`
